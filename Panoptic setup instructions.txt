In the server: 

	module load gcc/8.4.0-cuda python/3.7.7 cuda/11.1.1
	python3 -m venv panoptic_bev
	source panoptic_bev/bin/activate
	pip install --user torch==1.8.1+cu111 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu111/torch_stable.html
	pip install --user torchvision==0.9.1+cu111 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu111/torch_stable.html

Check Python, CUDA and PyTorch versions: (should be 3.7.7, 11.1, and 1.8.1+cu111 respectively)

	python --version
	nvcc --version
	python
		import torch
		print(torch.__version__)

Change these in the requirements.txt file:

	torch==1.8.1+cu111
	numpy~=1.19.5
	torchvision==0.9.1+cu111
	Pillow~=8.4.0

Install the requirements and setup:

	pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
	python setup.py develop --user

If no critical errors encountered so far:
    Install the nuScenes PanopticBEV dataset from http://panoptic-bev.cs.uni-freiburg.de/#dataset
    Modify the train_panoptic_bev_nuscenes.sh file, so that the directory paths are correct. You can check the .sh file we sent you as an example.
	In the script, you will see there is a master_addr and master_port. We weren't sure what to write for these, so we just randomly chose an IP and a port from the server via one of these commands:
         netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN
         hostname -I
	In Sinteract mode, move to the PanopticBEV/scripts folder
	    bash train_panoptic_bev_nuscenes.sh
	You should eventually see the first epoch being trained

If everything works, modify the pan_bev.sh we sent you, same as before. Run it with sbatch.
This script is essentially train_panoptic_bev_nuscenes.sh with added sbatch commands.
